# Web-Development-Practice-with-Bootstrap
Its my first basic project where I used django and bootstrap to create basic structure of a website
Here Websitee is my project name and Home is the first app that I have made . It consists of many files including my made file urls.py . Its a small site on which you can also submit your feedback and contact details.
The folder of templates consist of html files written with bootstrap and a few files written by using template inheritance
